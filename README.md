# Nava Mockup
## Prompt
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is the client. It's a large federal
agency that provides health coverage to more than 100 million people through
Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the
Health Insurance Marketplace (healthcare.gov). CMS manages and operates the
healthcare.gov website, where millions of U.S. residents who need to purchase
private health insurance can shop for and enroll in a plan.
CMS has asked your team to roughly prototype a responsive Marketplace page
that lists household members, based on the mockup below.
